# Financial_Dashboard_Analysis

**Power BI Dashboard**

**Overview**

**Objective:**

To analyze and visualize key financial metrics related to customer loans, defaults, and credit risk, and categorize customers and loans based on various factors like age, income, credit score, and loan type.

**Data Cleaning:**

The dataset was cleaned by categorizing data into different buckets (e.g., age, credit score, income), and verifying the data types across columns. Relationships were created between Customer_Details, Loan_Details, and Date tables.

**Data Analysis:**

DAX measures were used to calculate total loan amounts, average interest rates, monthly installments, customer demographics, loan status, and financial risk indicators like defaulted loans and high-risk loans.

**Data Visualization:**

Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and gauge visuals to explore loan portfolios, financial risk, and customer segmentation.

**Insights:**

Key findings include the distribution of loan types by status, the correlation between income and default rates, and the breakdown of loan risks by customer demographics.

**Deliverable:**

An interactive Power BI dashboard providing insights into customer segmentation, loan portfolio performance, and financial risk analysis, enabling better decision-making for loan approval and risk management.
